        <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Albert Eintein's life:</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>1879</strong> - Born on March 14 in Ulm, in the Kingdom of WÃ¼rttemberg, German Empire.</li>
          <li><strong>1884</strong> - Einstein's fascination with science is sparked when his father shows him a simple compass. He later describes the magnetic needle as "a miracle."</li>
          <li><strong>1895</strong> - At age 16, Einstein writes his first scientific paper, "The Investigation of the State of Aether in Magnetic Fields." He leaves school in Munich and moves to Switzerland, where he attends the Swiss Federal Polytechnic in Zurich.</li>
          <li><strong>1901</strong> - Graduates from Polytechnic but struggles to find a teaching position. Takes up work as a tutor while continuing his own research on physics.</li>
          <li><strong>1902</strong> - Begins work at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern, where he has time to develop his own scientific theories. Einstein would later say that the job gave him "peace and quiet to think."</li>
          <li><strong>1905</strong> - In what's known as his "miracle year" (Annus Mirabilis), Einstein publishes four groundbreaking papers. They include his special theory of relativity and the famous equation <i>E=mc<sup>2</sup></i>. He revolutionizes the understanding of light, space, time, and energy.</li>
          <li><strong>1909</strong> - Einstein's scientific fame grows, and he leaves the Patent Office to become a professor at the University of Zurich.</li>
          <li><strong>1915</strong> - Publishes the General Theory of Relativity, which describes how gravity warps space and time. This work would make him world-famous after it was confirmed by observations of a solar eclipse in 1919.</li>
          <li><strong>1919</strong> - Einstein's predictions about how light bends around the sun are confirmed by British astronomer Arthur Eddington during a solar eclipse, catapulting him into global celebrity. He becomes an international icon, known for his intellect and characteristic wild hair.</li>
          <li><strong>1921</strong> - Receives the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on the photoelectric effect, a discovery that was pivotal in establishing quantum theory.</li>
          <li><strong>1933</strong> - Leaves Germany after Adolf Hitler comes to power. Einstein, being Jewish, decides not to return from a visit to the U.S., accepting a position at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. He continues his research but also becomes more vocal about political and social issues, particularly in opposition to fascism.</li>
          <li><strong>1939</strong> - Signs a letter to U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, urging him to accelerate atomic research. This letter leads to the establishment of the Manhattan Project, though Einstein himself would not directly work on the atomic bomb.</li>
          <li><strong>1945</strong> - World War II ends with the use of atomic bombs, and Einstein becomes an advocate for nuclear disarmament, deeply regretful of the weapon's destructive potential.</li>
          <li><strong>1952</strong> - After the death of Israel's first president, Einstein is offered the presidency of Israel. He declines, stating that he lacks the skills required for politics.</li>
          <li><strong>1955</strong> - Einstein dies on April 18 in Princeton, New Jersey, at the age of 76. His last words, spoken in German, were not understood by the nurse attending him. His brain was preserved for study, revealing a unique structure that may have contributed to his extraordinary cognitive abilities.</li>
        </ul>
